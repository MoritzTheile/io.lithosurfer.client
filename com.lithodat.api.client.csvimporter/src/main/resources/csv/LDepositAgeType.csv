Igneous crystallisation,Age of igneous crystallisation of the igneous mineral or body,,,,,
Minimum crystallisation age,Minimum age for igneous crystallisation of the igneous body,Igneous crystallisation/,,,Concept verbatim from ListAgeGroup (UPb model),
Maximum crystallisation age,Maximum age for igneous crystallisation of the igneous body,Igneous crystallisation/,,,Concept edited from terminology of ListAgeGroup (UPb model),
Xenocrystic component,Age of xenocrystic component entrained within an igneous body. Xenocrysitic component must be older than the host body in which it resides,Igneous crystallisation/,,,New concept added,
